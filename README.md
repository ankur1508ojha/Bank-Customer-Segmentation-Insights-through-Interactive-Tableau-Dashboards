The purpose of this project is to analyze a dummy dataset for an imaginary bank in the United Kingdom. 

**Data Source:**
The dataset can be found and downloaded from the Super Data Science website under section 6.
The dataset consists of 4,014 rows that include the attributes of Customer ID, Name, Surname, Gender, Age, Region, Job Classification, Date Joined, and Balance.
Job Classification: White collar, Blue collar, and other.
Date Joined: Customers joined from January to December 2015.
Balance: Amount of money on the customer's account.

**Data Process**:
To compare regions, the data is grouped into 4 regions of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.
These regions will be used as filters for other attributes.
The data is distributed by balance, age, gender, and job classification.

**Customer Baseline:**

Dashboard | United Kingdom: The major customers in the United Kingdom are around 30-40 years old, which is about 50% of the entire customer base. 54% of the customers are male and 46% are female. White-collar customers are more prevalent in the UK than blue-collar or other job classifications.

Dashboard | England: In England, 70% of the customers are white-collar workers.

Dashboard | Scotland: Customers in Scotland are predominantly males in their late 40s and early 50s. The representation of white-collar workers is extremely low, only 7%.

Dashboard | Wales: The data for Wales shows an above-average representation of mid-size balances.
Dashboard | Northern Ireland: Northern Ireland is mostly represented by female customers in younger age groups than any other region.
